				<p>Dreams do come true!  For as long as he can remember, Matt's dream has been to own and operate a hot dog cart. Matt enjoys both cooking and meeting people, two things necessary to enjoy when owning and operating a food cart.</p>
				<p>In 2015, Matt was diagnosed with End Stage Liver Disease. As a result, Matt was unable to work for several years. He was fortunate enough to receive a liver transplant in 2016. Although it took a lot of work and determination, Matt was able to return to the workforce and works as a cook in the health industry. It was during this time that we realized how short life really is and that, if you can, you should chase your dreams.</p>
				<p>In 2020, amidst the pandemic, an opportunity arose that just couldn't be turned down. Matt received a call about purchasing a brand new and unique food cart that the manufacturer needed to sell. With just that one call, Matt's dream came true.</p>
				<p>Having purchased the food cart, the next step was to decide on a name and create a business. Matt's Hitchin' Kitchen is a family operated food cart business. It took a lot of work and learning to get the business created, permits obtained, and other logistics but we got it done. Although a huge learning experience, our first full year, 2021, went way better than expected. We are looking forward to many more.</p>
				<p>If you ever see us out and about, stop by and say hi. Matt will be cooking. Mindy will be running the business side (i.e. collecting the money from the sales). It is very likely that you will also see Mindy's mom, our children, and our grandchildren stop by to occasionally help out.</p>
